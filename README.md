## Project Overview
This project integrates AirSim with a dynamic network simulation framework designed for drone-based applications. The simulation models real-world network conditions such as latency, jitter, and packet loss, which are essential for testing drone performance in complex environments. In addition, it features ZeroMQ integration to enable efficient message exchange between drones and control systems, ensuring real-time communications.

## Introduction
### What is AirSim?
AirSim is an open-source simulator developed by Microsoft for testing autonomous systems. It offers a realistic simulation environment for a variety of applications, such as drone flight, computer vision, and machine learning.

### What does this project do?
This project combines AirSim with network simulation tools to test the behavior of drones under various network conditions. It integrates with ZeroMQ for message handling and uses dynamic network parameters (latency, jitter, packet loss) to simulate real-world communication challenges.

### Key Features:
- **Dynamic Network Simulation**: Simulate latency, jitter, and packet loss to model real-world network conditions.
- **ZeroMQ Integration**: Enables reliable message exchange between drones and control systems.
- **Customizable Environments**: Adjust simulation parameters to mimic different drone scenarios.

The goal of this project is to provide an end-to-end simulation environment where drone performance can be tested under controlled network conditions before deployment in real-world scenarios.

## Architecture
This project has a modular architecture with the following components:

- **AirSim Interface**: Handles drone control and interaction with the simulation environment.
- **Network Simulation Module**: Introduces network-related disturbances (latency, jitter, packet loss) into the communication channel between the control system and the drone.
- **ZeroMQ Integration**: A messaging system for sending and receiving commands between the drone and the controller, abstracting network complexities.
- **Control and Monitoring System**: Monitors the drone‚Äôs status and adjusts parameters in real-time based on network performance.
