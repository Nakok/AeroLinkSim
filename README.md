## Project Overview

This simulation environment models a drone's behavior while interacting with a control system over a network connection.
The environment uses **ZeroMQ** for communication, **AirSim** for drone simulation, and applies various network conditions to simulate real-world delays and interruptions.
This project integrates AirSim with a dynamic network simulation framework designed for drone-based applications. The simulation models real-world network conditions such as latency, jitter, and packet loss, which are essential for testing drone performance in complex environments. In addition, it features ZeroMQ integration to enable efficient message exchange between drones and control systems, ensuring real-time communications.

## Environment Design

The environment is implemented in a Python class that encapsulates the drone's behavior, the interaction with its controller, and the network simulation. The core of the environment is based on the **OpenAI Gym** interface, supporting functions like `reset`, `step`, and reward calculation.


## Introduction
### What is AirSim?
AirSim is an open-source simulator developed by Microsoft for testing autonomous systems. It offers a realistic simulation environment for a variety of applications, such as drone flight, computer vision, and machine learning.

### What does this project do?
This project combines AirSim with network simulation tools to test the behavior of drones under various network conditions. It integrates with ZeroMQ for message handling and uses dynamic network parameters (latency, jitter, packet loss) to simulate real-world communication challenges.

### Key Features:
- **Dynamic Network Simulation**: Simulate latency, jitter, and packet loss to model real-world network conditions.
- **ZeroMQ Integration**: Enables reliable message exchange between drones and control systems.
- **Customizable Environments**: Adjust simulation parameters to mimic different drone scenarios.

The goal of this project is to provide an end-to-end simulation environment where drone performance can be tested under controlled network conditions before deployment in real-world scenarios.

## üß† Architecture

The **AirSim-based simulation pipeline** provides a structured framework for training UAVs using Reinforcement Learning (RL) under **dynamically varying network conditions**.

At the core of this framework is the **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** agent, which acts as the decision-making module‚Äîmapping **sensory observations** to **control actions** in a **continuous action space**.

The agent interacts with the **AirSim environment**, a high-fidelity, physics-based simulator that models UAV dynamics, aerodynamics, and environmental disturbances. The simulated drone executes control commands‚Äî**pitch**, **roll**, **yaw**, and **throttle**‚Äîwhich directly influence its flight trajectory.

The environment then returns updated **state information**, including:
- UAV position  
- Velocity  
- Sensor data  

These observations form the basis for continuous policy learning.

### üåê Network Emulation

An extension of this pipeline introduces **network impairments** that mimic real-world conditions using **NetEm (Network Emulator)**. The following variations are simulated:
- Latency  
- Jitter  
- Packet loss  
- Bandwidth constraints  

These network-induced disruptions impact **real-time decision-making**, testing the agent's ability to operate under **impaired and fluctuating connectivity**.

A dedicated **reward calculation module** quantifies performance based on:
- Navigation efficiency  
- Policy robustness  
- Compliance with safety constraints  

This integrated **AirSim + PPO + NetEm** pipeline offers valuable insight into **RL-based flight control** within **decentralized**, **resource-constrained** environments.
